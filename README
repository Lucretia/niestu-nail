"For the want of a nail, the kingdom was lost."  -- Traditional proverb

NAIL is the NiEstu Application Infrastructure Library, a rather grand term for
what is really a simple set of packages that we find useful, and that we
didn't want to keep copying into every application's source directory.

Current build instructions are dirt simple:

   gcc -c [favorite-other-options] *.adb
   chmod -w *.{o,ali}

Some systems use "gnatgcc" instead of gcc.  Place the directory where your
GNAT builds can find it, either via a command-line option (-I, -aO, etc.), or
put it in your ADA_INCLUDE_PATH and ADA_OBJECT_PATH environment variables.

Bug reports welcome.  If you have this file, you presumably know where to
report them.
